# Clinical App for Pebble

This is a clinical watchapp for the Pebble smartwatch for use by clinicians in
Canadian acute care facilities. Currently, blood values are entered in metric units,
but this could be adapted to American units in the future.

This app is still in development and has not yet entered the beta stage. Some features
may not work properly yet.
